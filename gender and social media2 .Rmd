## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Gender and Facebook use
There is a stereotype that women are more sociable than men. Therefore we expect women to be more likely than men to have Facebook accounts.

H1 Gender is associated with Facebook use
(H0 Gender is not associated with Facebook use

```{r visualisation}
bes_2017 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Gender, fill = Use_Facebook)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge')

chisq.test(
  x = bes_2017$Gender,
  y = bes_2017$Use_Facebook
